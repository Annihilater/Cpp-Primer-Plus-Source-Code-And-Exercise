(CNN)President Donald Trump just offered a telling glimpse into his priorities as the coronavirus lengthens its trail of death and sickness.
Not bothering to hide his indifference and contempt for science, the President made clear on Sunday that it's more important to him to be ultimately proven right about the pandemic than to reconsider his disastrous approach that is doing little to stop its deadly spread.
Until then, America must endure crammed ICUs in virus-ravaged states, thousands more deaths and the prospect of cities slumping back into economically crippling lockdowns that crush hopes of a return to work and school with normal life as only a memory.

Trump's passive leadership becomes more neglectful the worse the crisis gets -- with more than 140,000 Americans now dead.
"I'll be right eventually. I will be right eventually. You know I said, 'It's going to disappear.' I'll say it again," Trump said in an interview on "Fox News Sunday."
